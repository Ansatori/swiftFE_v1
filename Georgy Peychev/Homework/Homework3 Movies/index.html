                            Sergeant Hartman, and the experiences of two of the platoon's Marines in the Tet Offensive during
                            the Vietnam War. The film's title refers to the full metal jacket bullet used by soldiers. The
                            film was released in the United States on June 26, 1987.

                        <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen

                            wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends
                            a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental
                            in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William
                            Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles.

                        <p>
                            Goodfellas (stylized as GoodFellas) is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. It is an adaptation of the
                            1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese.
                            The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill and his friends and family over
                            a period from 1955 to 1980. Scorsese initially titled the film Wise Guy and postponed making
                            it; later, he and Pileggi changed the title to Goodfellas. To prepare for their roles in the
                            film, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Ray Liotta often spoke with Pileggi, who shared research
                            material left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came
                            out of rehearsals wherein Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director
                            made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines he liked best and put them into a revised
                            script, which the cast worked from during principal photography. Made on a budget of $25 million,
                            Goodfellas grossed $46.8 million. It received positive reviews from critics and was nominated
                            for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, with Pesci winning Best Actor
                            in a Supporting Role. The film won five awards from the British Academy of Film and Television
                            Arts, including Best Film and Best Director. Additionally, Goodfellas was named the year's best
                            film by various critics' groups.
